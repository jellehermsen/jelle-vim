Jelle's Vim Color Scheme (or lack thereof)
==========================================

This is my take on a colorless Vim experience. You'll need to run a 256-color
terminal to use it. 

To install you can just drop jelle.vim in your ~/.vim/colors/ folder and set
`color jelle` in your vimrc.

This color scheme was based on [a great template made by Gerardo Gal√≠ndez]
(https://github.com/ggalindezb/Vim-Colorscheme-Template/).
